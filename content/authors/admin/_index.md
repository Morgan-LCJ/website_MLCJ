Welcome to my page! I am a Post-doctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark and a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. My research interests include party competition, political behaviour, and attitudes towards democratic institutions. 

In my work, I study the consequences of party polarization in European multiparty systems for citizensâ€™ political behavior and citizens' relationship toward parties. My thesis aims to assess the effect of party polarization on electoral participation, and whether this electoral mobilization is concentrated among (affectively polarized) partisans or a broader range of voters.

As part of the [DEMNORM](https://demnorm.github.io/) project, another field of my research focuses on challenges to democracy and, in particular, on the role of elites in shifting democratic norms. 

In general, I have a keen interest in research methods and I am specialized in mixed-methods designs. In my research, I use advanced quantitative methods such as multilevel modeling and experimental designs, and gained expertise in qualitative analysis using focus groups data.
