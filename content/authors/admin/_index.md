Welcome to my page! I am a Post-doctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark and was previously a PhD researcher in Political Science at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. My research interests include party competition, political behaviour, and attitudes towards democratic institutions. 

In my dissertation, I studied the consequences of party polarization in European multiparty systems for citizensâ€™ political behavior and citizens' relationship toward parties. My thesis assesses the effect of party polarization on electoral participation, and whether this electoral mobilization is concentrated among (affectively polarized) partisans or a broader range of voters.

As part of the [DEMNORM](https://demnorm.github.io/) project, my current research focuses on challenges to democracy and, in particular, on the role of elites in shifting democratic norms. 

In general, I have a keen interest in research methods and I am specialized in mixed-methods designs. In my research, I use advanced quantitative methods such as multilevel modeling and experimental designs, and gained expertise in qualitative analysis using focus groups data.
