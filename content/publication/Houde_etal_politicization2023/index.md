abstract: What are the consequences of the politicization of the European Union (EU) for the EU and European societies? While it is commonly assumed that politicization processes shape the EU, this book argues for the necessity to analyse politicization processes in terms of their consequences. It unpacks such consequences with a methodological pluralism which mobilizes conceptual approaches ranging from political sociology to intergovernmentalism and postfunctionalism. This book encompasses discussions on topics as diverse as public opinion, voting behaviour, public discourses, EU policy and policymaking, and European integration. These critical conversations make three key contributions to advance the scholarship. First, they show that both citizens and actors are reactive to the constraints and opportunities engendered by EU politicization. Second, they highlight how EU politicization produces differentiated consequences across countries, contexts, and issues. Third, the book strongly suggests that such consequences are best grasped in a dynamic way, reflecting on how episodes or strategies of (de)politicization are often complex rather than linear and systematic. Thus, our focus here shifts from analysing EU politicization processes per se, to in-depth empirical and normative analyses which grapple with their consequences.
